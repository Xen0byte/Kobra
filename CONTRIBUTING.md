Fork/Branch - Fork the repo or create a branch if i made u a collaborator (email me at pranavnt@outlook.com if you want me to make you a collaborator), and make all your changes there. Check to make sure CircleCI is set up on your branch :)

Main Branch - PR with a good description and make sure pranavnt is a reviewer

Testing Environment - Once we are solely focused on bug testing, we'll deploy to https://sparkedu.herokuapp.com for bug testing

Production Environment - Domain isn't finalized, but https://sparkedu.io is prob the top choice rn
